<sup>1</sup> For BrE and AuE /æ/ and /ɑ/ are merged into the [ae] phoneme.
> While incredibly weird looking, it works correctly and is fine.
> <br>The only minor quirk is that the model may swap northern and southern dialects with _tiny_ amounts of data.
> <br>Note that most singers standardize to the southern dialect. Regardless the model will learn the original dialect.
> <br>"I personally hate this but it works" - Heteric

<sup>2</sup> Some phonetic systems will also include [axr] as a label. This is entirely unnecessary and the [er] phoneme works flawlessly.
